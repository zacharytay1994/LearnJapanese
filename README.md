Can't find anyone who loves anime as much as you do?

# How to use
**Step One:** Download the python file.

**Step Two:** Search "Region and language settings" on your computer.

**Step Three:** Under "Related settings" click on "Administrative language settings".

**Step Four:** Click on "Change system locale" and select "Japanese(Japan)".

This will not affect your system and allows you to display japanese characters on your console. You can change it back after.

If you have IDLE, you can run it there as well!
